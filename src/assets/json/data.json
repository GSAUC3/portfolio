This framework offers simplified model training tools for classification and regression that require no prior machine learning or coding knowledge.\nAs a team leader, I successfully developed a computer vision application utilizing OpenCV, Mediapipe, easyocr and tkinter to convert handwritten words created through hand gestures into machine-readable text format.\nDeveloped a computer vision application that enables hands-free control of mouse functionalities and keyboard shortcuts through gesture recognition. This was achieved through the utilization of OpenCV and mediapipe technologies"
